What is the project?
Our project is based on the book 'Pride and Prejudice'. We started off with the basic stuff like word and letter frequency count. Then we created a graph that shows the comparision between the estimated occurence of a letter in english language and the actual occurence in the book (useful in cryptography). We also fitted in a code to deduct palindromes. The program is also able to handle input output errors while opening a file. 

What programming language?
Python 2.7.9
